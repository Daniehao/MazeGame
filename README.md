# MazeGame
## Homework 3 Instruction
All parts of the program are completed for this assignment. There are two samples in the main file. ###The sample 1 is a non-wrapping perfect maze, the input parameters are commented in my main method in Main class. The maze is a 3*4 perfect maze, and the user could reach to the target point by go down, go down, go right, go right. This sample will not go through each of the location but it will show that the perfect non wrapping maze works fine. Pay attention that the input for "whether it is a perfect maze" and the input for "whether it is a wrapping maze" should be true or false (lowercase required). All of the remains input should be numbers.

The sample 2 is a wrapping room maze, the input parameters are also commented in the main method follows by the first sample. The start point is (0,0) and the end point is (1,2), which covers all of the locations in the maze if you follows my operations. The operations are: go right, go right, go up, go left, go left, go up, go right, and go right. The player will also reach to the target point by running in this way.
